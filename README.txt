This was a project I attempted to undertake at the beginning of stay at home orders when I had the free time. It was meant to help me know what gear I was in, where my RPMs were and if I had engaged the pitlimiter for racing sim games. The plan was to hook it up to my steering wheel.

What inspired this was when playing Project Cars 2, with the cockpit view, some cars it was difficult to know what gear I was in, if I needed to shift up (some of the engines are surprisingly quite) and if I had engaged the pit limiter (on screen notification was being spotty, and most cars don't have it on the wheel/dash). I looked into buying one of these displays, but the cost was too prohibitive. What stopped me was that I ran out of time since I was able to work from home. 

Used was a simple seven segment display, a shift register, and 8 LEDs in conjunction with the arduino UNO. To make this work I recommend using 2 shift registers, one for the gear indicator and one for the RPM indicator. 

I've included a picture of the wired prototype on a bread board, and a video of how it works so far. If you find this and want to pick up where I left off, and fix any bugs please feel free to do so. 

Hopefully as things die down at work I have the time to pick it up again, work out any bugs, and find a way to hook it up the the Thrustmaster T150
